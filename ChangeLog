	(TokenPassSearch::compute_lm_hist_hash_code): Uses LM IDs instead of word
	IDs so that when using class-based language models, uses the class

	(TokenPassSearch::get_lm_bigram_lookahead): Performs the mapping from
	lookahead LM IDs to word IDs.
	(TokenPassSearch::get_lm_trigram_lookahead): Performs the mapping from
