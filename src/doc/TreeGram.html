<h1>Tree-structured ngram model</h1>

<p>
The ngram model is stored in a tree-structure.  Each node contains
<ul>
  <li> The index of the word
  <li> Log-probability
  <li> Back-off weight
  <li> Index of the first higher-order gram having the current prefix (child)
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p> The figure below shows an example structure containing 5 unigrams,
4 bigrams and 2 trigrams.

</center>

<p> Note that UNK is always the first node of the structure, even if
UNK was not specified in the model.  Note also, that nodes do not
always have children even if the child field of the node is positive
(node 2 in the figure, for example).

<h3>Invariants</h3>

<p>
The important invariants in the structure are
<ul>

  <li> If node[i] has one child or more, (node[i].child &gt; 0) and
  the number of children is (node[i+1].child - node[i])

  <li> node[i] does not have children, if and only if, either
  (node[i].child = -1) or (node[i+1].child = -1).  FIXME: is one
  possibility also that (node[i].child == node[i+1].child) (thirsima

</ul>

<h3>Correct procedure for adding nodes in the tree</h3>

<ul>

  <li> The order of the unigram is the <i>sorting order</i>

  <li> All grams must be inserted according to the sorting order.

  <li> Just before adding gram (a,b,c,d) to the vector of nodes

  <ul>
    <li> Let n be the node (a,b,c) and set n.child to (number of
    nodes) if n.child is -1
    <li> Let n be the node (a,b,c) and set (n+1).child to (number of
    nodes plus one)
  </ul>

</ul>
