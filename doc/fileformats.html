<h1>File formats</h1>

<h3>Hidden Markov model</h3>

The model is stored in four separate text files:
<ul>
  <li> gk-file: Gaussian kernels: centers and variances.
  <li> mc-file: Mixture coefficients: weights of the kernels for each mixture
  <li> ph-file: Phonemes: transitions and mixtures for states of the phonemes
  <li> cfg-file: The feature configuration
</ul>

<h5>gk-file</h5>

The file begins with a line containing the number of kernels,
dimension, and a string "single_cov", "diagonal_cov", "full_cov", "pcgmm" or "scgmm".
If Precision constrained or Subspace constrained GMM (PCGMM or SCGMM) is used, the basis 
dimension is given last on the first line, and equivalently many next lines are dedicated
to the basis vectors.
Then follows each kernel on a separate line. The kernel is represented by
its mean values and a variance value in case of single_cov, or
diagonal covariance values in case of diagonal_cov. Full covariances are in
the basic rows/columns order (symmetricity). For Pcgmm, the mean values are followed
by the precision coefficients. For Scgmm, there are only the exponential subspace coefficients
All these numbers are on the same line for one gaussian, separated by spaces.

<h5>mc-file</h5>

<p>
The file begins with a line containing the number of HMM states.
Then comes one line for each state. These lines begin with the number
of kernels for that state, followed by pairs of numbers stating the
kernel indices and weights. The kernel indices are the line numbers
(minus two) of the gk-file.

<h5>ph-file</h5>

This format is the same as the one used by a decoder "Noway".
The first line of the file contains word "PHONE". The second line is the
number of phonemes. Then for each phoneme comes the next lines:
<ul>
  <li> Line containing the phoneme index, number of states in this phoneme and
       the phoneme label.
  <li> Line with the state indices, referring to the lines of the mc-file.
       Value -1 is the entering and -2 the exit state, and these are just dummy states
       with no emission probabilities.
  <li> For each phoneme state a line beginning with the relative state index,
       followed by the number of transitions in that state, and then the transitions
       represented by pairs of relative state indices and transition probabilities.
</ul>

<h5>Configuration file (cfg-file)</h5>

<p>
Feature configuration file. See feature_configuration.txt.

Numbers are in samples.  Ending time is the first sample after the
phoneme.


<h3>Basebind</h3>

This file is used to define the HMM states for segfea in model initialization.
Note that the states are allowed to be shared between the phonemes
(state tying).

Start time and end time are in seconds. First line means the first phn-line to be included and so on: counting starts from 1. If timelimits and linelimits overlap, the most limiting factor is used.


<h3>LNA_file</h3>

The LNA file contains the log-probabilities of the states for each
frame.

<pre>
Bytes	Field
------------------------------------------------------------
4	the number of states (S)
1	bytes per probability (B)

B	log-prob of state 0 in frame 0
