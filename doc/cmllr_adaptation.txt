Constrained MLLR adaptation

The application mllr can calculate a CMLLR adaptation matrix. Adaptation matrices are stored in the speaker configuration files. 
There are 2 implementations of the real transform, effectively the same:
- transform at feature level: the transformation is implemented as a "linear tranformation module". The model configuration file should reflect this
- transform at model level: the transformation is implemented "in the model". This means the feature vectors are adapted on Gaussian Level. This option does not need a change is the cfg file, but is a small bit slower (~2%)
If a feature module name is given to "mllr" a feature transform is trained. Otherwise a model transform is trained. In a speaker file, the different transforms are prefixed by "feature" and "model".

Regression Class Tree CMLLR
If you want to use multiple adaptation matrices per speaker a Regression Class Tree can be used. When a tree is used only a model transformation is possible (see previous).

A regression tree is build based on a statistics file (generated by the model and training recipe). The tree is generated with the regtree application. The units Phoneme, Mixture and Gaussian define the unit used to build the tree. Mixtures can not be used when Gaussians are shared between Mixtures. Gaussian seems to give the best results, but all three options are close. For Gaussian the tree file and speaker file will be biggest. The tree will be stored in a plain text file, with on every line a node of the tree. This file has to be provided to the mllr application.
